#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
  SELECT COUNT (*) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
  SELECT COUNT (product)
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  WHERE product = "iPhone";

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
  SELECT acctnum
  FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
  INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
  ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
  WHERE length(orderid) = 6
  AND orderid<> "Order ID";

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
  SELECT product, MIN (price)
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;


#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
  SELECT product, SUM (quantity) * price AS revenue
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  GROUP BY product;
  
#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
  SELECT product, SUM (quantity) AS quantity, SUM (quantity) * price AS revenue
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
  WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
  GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
  SELECT 
  COUNT (cust.acctnum), 
  Avg(quantity * price)
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
  LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
  ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
  WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
  AND length (orderid) = 6 
  AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

Bonus: List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
  SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
  WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
  GROUP BY product;
